Ideas for thesis – look at proposal too What’s interesting about this example is that all the gender differences are from students, not teacher interactionsCommon refrain is that men are more confident in their abilitiesWomen are more attracted to group work and inequity aversion, leading to women who are able helping people more than men who are able, see if this is a trend in the data as well. Overall out degree is the same but we might see that the able women have a larger out degree but all the successful have a larger out degree so the question is if that difference is greater Women’s propensity to work in groups more related to higher perceptions of other people too which might also increase the chance degree of women with access to the network Best option probably isn’t to ban collaboration Big problem is people without access to the network, or even aware that the network exists SOME STUFF FROM SOCY MIDTERM THAT IS A GOOD REFERENCEThe node with the lowest network constraint is 7 and has a network constraint of 0.2. This makes sense because we can see that node 7 exists in the center of our network diagram and links groups of nodes that would otherwise be disconnected. This is someone who would have access to a lot of different ideas from different parts of the network. The node with the highest betweenness is 7 and has a betweenness of 50. This means that node 7 is on a lot of shortest paths between other nodes and thus has opportunities for social capital and brokerage. The node with the highest degree is 7 and has a degree of 5. This illustrates that node 7 is very important because not only does this node have the highest degree which means it can reach the most other nodes directly but it also has a low constraint which means that connects otherwise disconnected regions and has a high betweenness which raises its social capital. Since 7 is the highest on all of these metrics we can be pretty sure that is likely the most important node.
